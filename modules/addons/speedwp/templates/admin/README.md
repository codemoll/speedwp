# SpeedWP Admin Templates

This directory is reserved for future admin area template files.

Currently, the admin area output is generated directly in the AdminController.php file using HTML strings. This provides immediate functionality while keeping the implementation simple.

## Future Enhancement

Admin templates can be added here in the future to separate presentation from logic:

- `dashboard.tpl` - Admin dashboard template
- `sites.tpl` - Sites management template  
- `clients.tpl` - Client management template
- `settings.tpl` - Settings configuration template
- `tools.tpl` - Tools and utilities template

## Current Implementation

The admin area currently uses direct HTML generation in `controllers/AdminController.php` which provides:

- Full dashboard with statistics and recent activity
- Demo data fallback when database is empty
- Navigation between different admin sections
- Functional interface for WordPress management

This approach ensures immediate functionality while maintaining simplicity for the initial implementation.
